It feels like a hesitant push into adulthood, like casting yourself away from everything familiar and into a strange place with more responsibilities. Sure the pandemic had its hand in delaying this, but being tied down to one place for over two years did feel like pausing adulting for a while.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nI have never really lived in one place for more than a couple of years. And perhaps so, I don’t feel like calling any of these places home. Lagos and Rourkela are memories that I’ll cherish for years. But in a way, there’s a finality to these places and their memories. Essentially they are phases of my life I’ve lived through, so it would be pointless to long to return. Maybe they were ‘home’ of a bygone time, but no more.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nThe novelty of starting over can be overwhelming. Initially, you miss everything mundane about your old life as you get used to the new surroundings. And with a lot of things, it feels like starting from square one.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nYet, the freedom of being on your own is exhilarating. Checking out the local pubs and breweries would be one way to get a taste of the city and its vibe. I’d recommend checking out the local bookstore too. There's something therapeutic about browsing physical books in a bookstore. (Check out Blossoms if you’re nearby). Look into treks that can be done nearby and go for it. Creating new memories with new people would be a sure-shot way of breaking into a new place and making it feel like home. I have always associated playlists with different phases of my life. Spend some time adding your recent songs to a playlist and now you’ve got something to commemorate this phase of your life.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nFor someone who loves walking around a lot, Bengaluru streets are quite the contrast with the desolate campus roads in Rourkela. On some days, the hustle and bustle of the city get to me and I miss everything about the slow college-town life in Odisha. If you find yourself in the same situation, look around and breathe in the new surroundings. Notice the little things. Like the cats and dogs. Or the trees growing along the street. Or the dog that lives near the gym that has grown depressingly habituated to the sea of humans around? I wonder how long it has been here.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nSometimes I wonder how people end up calling a place home. I like to think that it's the people and memories they shared that create an illusion of a place being ‘home’, which otherwise would be hollow by itself. It’s also funny to think that some people have called the place I live 'home', some still do, and others have moved on. Like my old hostel room and the rooms of friends surrounding it. Probably another group of people has taken over the place, hopefully, good friends too.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nI’d like to think of this as a transformative phase, where you come out all older and wiser. There was a time not so long ago when I was figuring my way around college life, and I’ve come a long way since. The novelty of being on my own is slowly coming off, but the responsibilities seem to pile on each day. But somehow this is what I have always wanted. It feels very Murakami-ish to be on my own, creating a life for myself in a new place.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nThe uncertainty of where the path I’ve chosen could take me bemuses me time and again. Luckily I enjoy the work I do and would like to continue doing it for the foreseeable future. But the vastness of the paths I could’ve taken and thoughts of being tied down to one line of work weigh down on me sometimes. But again who doesn't relate to this, maybe? Do teachers in remote corners of the country feel like moving to more happening places? Do travel bloggers ever feel like calling it a day and settling down in a quaint town in the mountains?\r\n<br>\n<br>\nHow long do I see myself living here? What if I end up staying here for 10 years? That’s a serious amount of time to spend in one place. A decent chunk of the human lifespan. And yet people live out their entire lives in one lone corner of the world without any regrets. I’m growing older and time won’t come back. Scary. What if I somehow end up staying here for good? Scarier. The nomad in me panics now and then and reminds me not to tie myself to one place for life.\r\n<br>\n<br>\nI shall be telling this with a sigh<br>\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:<br>\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>\nI took the one less travelled by,<br>\nAnd that has made all the difference.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMaybe I just like to catastrophize trivial changes in my life.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Moving"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"moving"}},
